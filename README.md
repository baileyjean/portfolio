## Description

Everybody needs a portfolio, which is why I created **BaileyCodes**. It will be periodically updated with any projects I might be working on, showcase some of the front-end skills I've gained since starting General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, and serve as a living resume that I can point potential employers to. Feedback is most welcome!
