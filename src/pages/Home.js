To win, you must reach your profit goal, have a non-zero bank account, and have at least one remaining life by the time you get back to square 1. On each turn, you pull one of the cards from the Doge Deck. Stats are updated after each dice roll. The game uses a fun combination of "doge-speak" and topical meme-references throughout the user's experience. Full descriptions of the six different cards can be found on the landing page for the game!`,
